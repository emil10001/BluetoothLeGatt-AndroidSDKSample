# BluetoothLeGatt Android SDK Sample
==========================

This project is the sample provided in the samples for API level 18
convereted for Android Studio. No code changes have taken place, the
only modifications were the directory structure, and adding some
Gradle files.

The other intention is to make this sample easier to find for anyone
searching for an Android sample for working with Bluetooth LE (4.0,
BLE, Smart, etc.). This is a really neat sample, so download it and
test it out yourself.

I have not made any code modifications to this project, nor will I.
